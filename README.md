# AlgoGame: Learn Algorithms Through Play

## Introduction
AlgoGame is an interactive educational platform designed to introduce secondary students in Hong Kong to the world of algorithms. Specifically tailored for those studying Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and new to algorithmic concepts, AlgoGame makes learning engaging and accessible through gamification.

## Inspiration & Purpose
This project is inspired by the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDuwnTSeCs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDuwnTSeCs) and the principles of gamification-based learning. Recognizing a gap in the availability of visually interesting and sufficiently simple games for algorithm beginners, AlgoGame aims to bridge this gap by providing an intuitive and fun learning experience.

## How to Play
You can visit the live version of AlgoGame at [edmangog.github.io/AlgoGame/](https://edmangog.github.io/AlgoGame/) to start your algorithmic journey!

## Reporting Issues
If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please report them in the [Issues tab on GitHub](https://github.com/edmangog/AlgoGame/issues). Your feedback is valuable in making AlgoGame better!

## Currently Available Games
AlgoGame currently features interactive games for fundamental algorithms:

*   **Bubble Sort Game**: Sort numbers by swapping adjacent elements.
*   **Insertion Sort Game 1 (Swapping)**: Build a sorted list by repeatedly swapping the key element with its left neighbor.
*   **Insertion Sort Game 2 (Shifting)**: Build a sorted list by shifting elements to make space and inserting the key element.
*   **Binary Search Game**: Master decrease-and-conquer searching by narrowing down the search range.

## Future Enhancements & Vision
AlgoGame is continuously evolving with a vision to create a more immersive and rewarding learning experience. Future plans include:

### Gamification Elements
*   **User Profile & Progress System**: Persistent user profiles, custom avatars, and progress tracking.
*   **Achievement System**: Algorithm-specific badges, detailed statistics, and visual progress indicators.
*   **Algorithm Skill Tree**: A visual representation of algorithm relationships, prerequisites, and unlockable advanced algorithms.

### Enhanced Game Mechanics
*   **Challenge Modes**: Timed challenges and real-world problem-solving scenarios (e.g., optimizing MTR routes).
*   **Competitive Elements**: Leaderboards and potential multiplayer features.
*   **Narrative Context**: Algorithm mascot characters and storylines connecting algorithms to Hong Kong contexts.

### New Algorithm Games
*   **Quick Sort Game**: Interactive pivot selection and partitioning visualization.
*   **Graph Algorithm Games**: Pathfinding and network visualization games (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm using MTR map).
*   **Data Structure Games**: Interactive visualizations for stacks, queues, binary trees, hash tables, and linked lists.

### Technical Improvements
*   **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design and touch controls for various devices.
*   **Visual Enhancements**: Modern UI, dark mode, and improved animations.
*   **Teacher Tools**: Classroom management features, assignment creation, and student progress analytics.

The project aims to adhere to educational design principles such as learning-first approach, immediate feedback, multiple representations, scaffolded progression, meaningful choices, and celebrating success.
