# AlgoGame: Learn Algorithms Through Play üéÆüìö

## Introduction
AlgoGame is an interactive learning platform designed to introduce secondary school students in Hong Kong to the world of algorithms. Tailored for beginners in Information and Communication Technology (ICT), it makes algorithmic concepts engaging and accessible through gamification.

## Inspiration & Purpose
AlgoGame was created to make algorithm learning fun, intuitive, and approachable for students who may find abstract concepts difficult at first.

It draws inspiration from gamification-based learning principles and was inspired by [Â§èsirÁ∂≤‰∏äÊïôÂÆ§] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDuwnTSeCs). The project seeks to transform algorithm practice into enjoyable games that encourage active participation and exploration.

## Currently Games
AlgoGame currently features interactive games for fundamental algorithms:

*   **Bubble Sort Game**: Sort numbers by swapping adjacent elements.
*   **Insertion Sort Game 1 (Swapping)**: Build a sorted list by repeatedly swapping the key element with its left neighbor.
*   **Insertion Sort Game 2 (Shifting)**: Build a sorted list by shifting elements to make space and inserting the key element.
*   **Binary Search Game**: Master decrease-and-conquer searching by narrowing down the search range.

## Roadmap & Vision üöÄ
AlgoGame is continuously evolving to provide a richer, more rewarding learning experience. Planned enhancements include:

### Gamification Elements
*   **User Profile & Progress System**: Save progress, create custom avatars, and track learning milestones.
*   **Achievement System**: Algorithm-specific badges, detailed statistics, and visual progress indicators.
*   **Algorithm Skill Tree**: A visual representation of algorithm relationships, prerequisites, and unlockable advanced algorithms.

### Enhanced Game Mechanics
*   **Challenge Modes**: Timed challenges and real-world problem-solving scenarios (e.g., optimizing MTR routes).
*   **Competitive Elements**: Leaderboards and potential multiplayer features.
*   **Narrative Context**: Algorithm mascot characters and storylines connecting algorithms to Hong Kong contexts.

### New Algorithm Games
*   **Quick Sort Game**: Interactive pivot selection and partitioning visualization.
*   **Graph Algorithm Games**: Pathfinding and network visualization games (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm using MTR map).
*   **Data Structure Games**: Interactive visualizations for stacks, queues, binary trees, hash tables, and linked lists.

### Technical Improvements
*   **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design and touch controls for various devices.
*   **Visual Enhancements**: Modern UI, dark mode, and improved animations.
*   **Teacher Tools**: Classroom management features, assignment creation, and student progress analytics.

## Educational Philosophy
AlgoGame follows key principles of effective learning design:
* Learning-first approach
* Immediate feedback
* Multiple representations
* Scaffolded progression
* Meaningful choices
* Celebrating success
